Premise In 2017 the most popular web games like agar.io are networked via WebSockets over TCP. If a UDP equivalent of WebSockets could be incorporated into browsers, it would greatly improve the networking of these games.
Background Web browsers are built on top of HTTP, which is a stateless request/response protocol initially designed for serving static web pages.

Many people will tell you that implementing your own reliable message system on top of UDP is foolish.Â After all, why reimplement TCP?
But why limit ourselves to how TCP works? But thereÂ are so many different ways to implement reliable-messages and most of them workÂ nothing like TCP!

In theÂ previous articleÂ we implemented packet fragmentation and reassembly so we can send packets larger than MTU.
This approach works great when the data block you&rsquo;re sending is time critical and can be dropped, but in other cases you need to send large blocks of quickly and reliably over packet loss, and you need the data to get through.

In the previous article, we created a bitpacker but it required manual checking to make sure reading a packet from the network is safe. This is a real problem because the stakes are particularly high - a single missed check creates a vulnerability that an attacker can use to crash your server.

In the previous article we discussed techniques for compressing snapshots.
In this article we round out our discussion of networked physics strategies with state synchronization, the third and final strategy in this article series.
State Synchronization What is state synchronization? The basic idea is that, somewhat like deterministic lockstep, we run the simulation on both sides but, unlike deterministic lockstep, we don&rsquo;t just send input, we send both input and state.

In the previous article we sent snapshots of the entire simulation 10 times per-second over the network and interpolated between them to reconstruct a view of the simulation on the other side.
The problem with a low snapshot rate like 10HZ is that interpolation between snapshots adds interpolation delay on top of network latency.

In the previous article we networked a physics simulation using deterministic lockstep. Now, in this article we&rsquo;re going to network the same simulation with a completely different technique: snapshot interpolation.
Background While deterministic lockstep is very efficient in terms of bandwidth, it&rsquo;s not always possible to make your simulation deterministic.

In the previous article we explored the physics simulation we&rsquo;re going to network in this article series. In this article specifically, we&rsquo;re going to network this physics simulation using deterministic lockstep.
Deterministic lockstep is a method of networking a system from one computer to another by sending only the inputs that control that system, rather than the state of that system.

Lately I&rsquo;ve been doing some research into networking game physics simulations via deterministic lockstep methods.
The basic idea is that instead of synchronizing the state of physics objects directly by sending the positions, orientations, velocities etc. over the network, one could synchronize the simulation implicitly by sending just the player inputs.

Have you ever wondered how multiplayer games work?
From the outside it seems magical: two or more players sharing a consistent experience across the network like they actually exist together in the same virtual world.
But as programmers we know the truth of what is actually going on underneath is quite different from what you see.

In the previous article, we added our own concept of virtual connection on top of UDP. In this article weâ€™re going to add reliability, ordering and congestion avoidance to our virtual UDP connection.
The Problem with TCP Those of you familiar with TCP know that it already has its own concept of connection, reliability-ordering and congestion avoidance, so why are we rewriting our own mini version of TCP on top of UDP?

In the previous article we sent and received packets over UDP. Since UDP is connectionless, one UDP socket can be used to exchange packets with any number of different computers. In multiplayer games however, we usually only want to exchange packets between a small set of connected computers.
