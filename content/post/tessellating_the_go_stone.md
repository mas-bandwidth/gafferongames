## Introduction

Hi, I'm [Glenn Fiedler](https://gafferongames.com). Welcome to [**Virtual Go**](/categories/virtual-go/), my project to create a physically accurate computer simulation of a Go board and stones.

In this article we want to draw the go stone using <a href="http://www.opengl.org">OpenGL</a>. 

Unfortunately we can't just tell the graphics card, "Hey! Please draw the intersection of two spheres with radius r and d apart with a bevel torus r<sub>1</sub> and r<sub>2</sub>!", because modern 3D graphics cards work by drawing triangles. We have to take our mathematical definition of the go stone and turn it into a set of triangles that the graphics card can render.

This is called tessellation and there are several different ways to do it.

## Longitude And Lattitude

The first way that I tried was to consider sphere rendering like a globe with longitude/latitude. I started with a ring around the 'equator' of the go stone, stepping these rings up to the top of the sphere like the north pole on a globe.

Unfortunately, just like longitude/latitude on a globe, tessellating this way leads to very distorted mapping around the pole and a lot of wasted triangles:

## Triangle Subdivision

The next method is triangle subdivision. You start with an approximate shape then subdivide each triangle into four smaller triangles recursively like this:

Since the go stone only needs the top 1/3 or 1/4 of a sphere, I didn't want to subdivide a whole sphere only to throw most of it away. So I designed my own subdivision algorithm to generate only the top section of a sphere.

After some trial and error I found that a pentagon plus a center vertex at the pole of the sphere was a good initial generator that minimized the distortion that occurs during subdivision. The only tricky part is that when subdividing you need to keep track of whether the edge is a sphere edge or a circle edge, as the subdivided vertex must be projected differently.

With this technique I was able to generate a much more efficient tessellation:

## Tessellating The Bevel

Now we need to tesselate the bevel. To do this I take the vertices which form the circle edge at the bottom of the top sphere surface and calculate the angle of each vertex about the y axis. I then use these angles to sweep around the torus ensuring that the torus vertices weld perfectly with the top and bottom sphere sections.

## Vertex Welding

Due to how recursive subdivision works a lot of duplicate vertices are generated. 

I'd rather not have the graphics card waste time transforming the same vertex over and over, so as I add vertices to the mesh I hash vertex positions into a 3D grid (~1mm cells) and reuse an existing vertex if the position and normals match within some small epsilon value.

With vertex welding the reduction in vertices is dramatic: 53000 to just 6500.

For more information on vertex welding please refer to the discussion in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Real-Time-Collision-Detection-Interactive-Technology/dp/1558607323/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1363029675&sr=8-1&keywords=real+time+collision+detection">Real-Time Collision Detection</a> by <a href="http://realtimecollisiondetection.net/blog/">Christer Ericson</a>.
